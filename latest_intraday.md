## Leader pullback setups — quality grade picks WHAT, the pullback picks WHEN
Top 10% of the universe by quality grade (>= 9/12 traits, beating SPY over 3 months), pulling back: RSI2<10 or a touch of the 21-day EMA. Entry/stop/target are ESTIMATES.

### How to read this (concentration & sizing)
- ✅ **Discipline:** take the highest-ranked, least-correlated names. Per-name cap 30% of account value; target 3-4 concurrent positions, minimum entry ~$600. Equity capital excludes the 20% options bucket and the 5% reserve. The agent places NO stop (HARD RULE 5): exits are the RSI2>=70 take-profit on a green position, the GRADE EXIT (rank leaves the top 25%), and Ryan's native trail once green enough.

**Excluded — RSI2 dips on names that are NOT leaders** (the old screen would have bought these; the grade filters them out): CVS (C 3/12), VLO (B 8/12)

## Quality ranking — top 25 of 235 (A = buyable, B = holdable)
Value = valuation grade vs the name's own 10-yr multiples; Disruption = is the business being disrupted or doing the disrupting (legends under the joint section). Display only: neither changes the grade.

## Joint long-term port — accumulate signals (oversold within an uptrend)
Watch-only — the agent can't trade the joint account, so this surfaces BUY/ADD ideas ONLY (no exit alerts, not part of the ACTION trigger). **Primary signal is TECHNICAL:** a confirmed long-term uptrend (price above a RISING 200-day MA + positive 12-1 momentum) that is **oversold / pulled back** on the technicals (RSI + moving averages), ranked most-oversold first. **Signal:** 🟢 oversold (RSI14 ≤ 35 or RSI2 < 10) / 🟡 dip. **Value** = the valuation grade: how far the price sits from what the name's own 10-year multiples imply (positive = undervalued by that much), with the multiples chosen for its industry. Within each signal tier, cheaper names rank first.

_The technical screen is the SIGNAL (oversold within an uptrend); the valuation grade says whether the price is cheap for that business, and the disruption grade says whether the business itself is under threat. Confirm each with the news/thesis (HARD RULE 7) before buying: a name can sit below its own history because its future really is worse._

_Valuation grade: DEEP VALUE >= +25% below fair | UNDERVALUED +10 to +25% | FAIR within 10% | RICH 10-25% above | EXPENSIVE > 25% above. Fair = the price at the stock's own 10-year median multiples, using the multiples that suit its industry: banks/insurers on book value, REITs on cash flow, cyclicals (energy, materials, miners, semis, autos, homebuilders) on sales and book with earnings multiples dropped at a peak or trough, growth on sales/EBITDA/FCF, everyone else on earnings/EBITDA/FCF. Confidence (HIGH/MED/LOW) drops when the margin cycle is extreme, the business has changed shape, the multiples disagree, or analysts' median target points the other way. Analysts = median 12-month target vs price. Relative to its OWN past only: when the whole market is above its history, most names read RICH._

_Disruption grade: is a changing trend or new technology making this business obsolete (AT RISK / BEING DISRUPTED), or is its innovation creating a new, untapped market (DISRUPTOR / INNOVATING)? The research note (dated, sourced) is the main judgment; the quant layer is an early warning. Quant layer: 10 years of revenue, gross margin and R&D plus analysts' next-year revenue (shrinking or fading revenue and eroding gross margin = threat; fast or accelerating growth, expanding margin and heavy R&D = innovator), plus MARKET FEAR when a stock with normal margins trades >= 40% below its own historical multiples. Cyclicals use 5-yr trends at LOW confidence; banks, insurers and REITs are judged on revenue only. A dated research note (competitors, emerging tech, new markets, with sources) moves the label one step. VALUE TRAP = cheap vs history but AT RISK or BEING DISRUPTED._

## SWING_M picks — grade context (display only, never a filter)
This month's top-10 by 12-month return, traded mechanically by the sleeve. The valuation and disruption grades are shown for context only: the tested rules have no such filter and the standing ban forbids adding one without a live Ryan turn (see grades_filter_results.md for the backtest of using them as a filter).

## Options candidates (sleeve: options — single-leg LONG)
Underlyings only, drawn from the quality grade: CALLS on top-graded leaders, PUTS on bottom-graded laggards. **Options bucket = 20% of account value, no per-trade cap; paused if the bucket loses 40%** (see CLAUDE.md HARD RULE 8). Pick the contract off the live chain (21-45 DTE, ~0.35 delta) and grade it with options_grade.grade_contract() on current quotes; only a combined A/A+ may enter.
